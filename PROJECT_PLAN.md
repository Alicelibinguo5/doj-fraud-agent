## Project Plan 

I want to use the file to write my project plan to use llm to help achieve each feature 

- 1. add llm platform to manage workflow: done, use langchain
- 2. Build LLM Judge as eval layer to improve accuracy
    - create evaluate.py to use ragas for quick evals result for accuracy
- 3. Build langgraph for agent that make llm call and output result
    -  then evaluate result w score
    - push score to langfuse
- 4. streamlit dashboard works, but it is not pretty or result is not displayed clearly, can you pototype react UI for me to use same api endpoint and display latest search ?
- 5. Create architecture diagram using excaldraw
- 6. Edge case handling 
   - 6.1- add work flow to scrap key word from video format 9 https://www.justice.gov/news/videos)
- 7. LangGraph: add human in the loop feedback to help agent improve accuracy
- 8: add Langfuse portal(https://us.cloud.langfuse.com/project/cmdckuujh0bvnad07ptolsqrb/scores) in README.md

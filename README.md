## Why?
The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners is the largest fraud fighting organization on the planet. In addition to providing a world-renowned certification, the ACFE also produces various research studies to support fraud examiners globally. These studies have primairly been based on surveys and responses from ACFE membership.

This tool is an effort to expand the research capabilities of the ACFE by examining active U.S. Department of Justice (and, hopefully in the future, other jurisdictions) fraud and money laundering investigations, indictments, and recent convictions. The ability to rapidly analyze DOJ activity can help fraud examiners stay on top of new fraud trends and see what law enforcement is working on to better inform referrals and tips.

## How it Works

- **React Dashboard**: Modern, responsive web UI with real-time feedback
- **FastAPI Backend**: Handles scraping, analysis, and LLM-powered fraud detection
- **LangGraph Orchestration**: Intelligent workflow management with human-in-the-loop feedback
- **Langfuse Integration**: Comprehensive tracing and evaluation metrics
- **Docker Compose**: One command to run everything

## Quickstart

1. **Clone & Enter the Repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alicelibinguo5/doj-fraud-agent.git
   cd doj-fraud-agent
   ```

2. **Run with Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   docker compose build
   docker compose up
   ```
   - React Dashboard: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - FastAPI Backend: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
   - Langfuse Portal: [https://us.cloud.langfuse.com/project/cmdckuujh0bvnad07ptolsqrb/scores](https://us.cloud.langfuse.com/project/cmdckuujh0bvnad07ptolsqrb/scores)

3. **(Optional) Local Development**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
   
   # Frontend
   cd frontend/react-dashboard
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

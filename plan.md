I want to use the file to write my project plan to use llm to help achieve each feature 

- 1. add llm platform to manage workflow: done, use langchain
- 2. Build LLM Judge as eval layer to improve accuracy
    - create evaluate.py to use ragas for quick evals result for accuracy
- 3. Build langgraph for agent that make llm call and output result
    -  then evaluate result w score
    - push score to langfuse
- 4. Create architecture diagram using excaldraw
